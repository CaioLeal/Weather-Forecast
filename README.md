### 📍 Why this Project?

* The idea came from the need to create a functional application that consumes real data. It is a weather forecast website where the main focus was to practice consuming external APIs (**OpenWeatherMap**), DOM manipulation, and creating a pleasant interface. In the future, the project will support multiple languages and animated backgrounds according to the weather! 🌧️☀️
